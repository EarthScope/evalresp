To compile evalresp from this distribution, follow these steps (these
instructions were tested on Windows 10 with Visual Studio 12, but a
similar approach has worked with earlier evalresp releases on earlier
Windows):

0. Prepare the target environment.  You must have installed:

   * Visual Studio 12 (VS2013) (the free community version is fine)

   * The libxml2, iconv and zlib libraries and headers.  These can be
     downloaded from http://www.zlatkovic.com/libxml.en.html
     Each library should be unpacked in the same directory as evalresp
     (see below), without version numbers, so the final directory tree
     from your working directory will look like:

         +-- evalresp-[version]
         | +-- doc
         | +-- src
         | +-- ...
         +-- libxml2
         | +-- bin
         | +-- include
         | +-- ...
         +-- iconv
         | +-- bin
         | +-- include
         | +-- ...
         +-- zlib
           +-- bin
           +-- include
           +-- ...

1. Unzip the distribution file.  The simplest way to do this is to use
   the file explorer: right click and select "Expand all".

2. Open the Visual Studio command line tools by typing "Visual Studio
   Tools" in the search bar, selecting the application, and then
   clicking on "Developer Command Prompt for VS2013".

3. In the command prompt:

   cd working\directory\evalresp-[version]\src
   NMAKE /F Makefile.ms

4. This should build the executables.  You must then configure windows
   PATH in the usual way before running them.

   For example, from the command line, in the same directory where you
   built the code, for a quick test:

   set PATH=%PATH%;..\..\libxml2\bin;..\..\iconv\bin;..\..\zlib\bin
   .\evalresp
