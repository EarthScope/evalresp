This directory contains a Java program that generates the target response
file for check_convert.c using the IRIS-WS library.

In this way, we can make sure that the output from xml2resp is identical
to that produced by IRIS-WS.

Before running the script, the IRIS-WS jar file (of the correct version)
must be added to (or linked to) this directory.
