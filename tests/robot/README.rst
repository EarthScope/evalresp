The directory structure here is:

  robot/      # this directory
    all/        # all tests (the actual robot test scripts)
      base/       # base tests (given explicitly)
        <name>/     # additional grouping of base tests
      extended/   # extended tests (generated by script)
        YYYY-DDD/   # extended tests for the given date
    data/       # input files (tarballs also cached here)
      base/       # input files used in base tests
      extended/   # files used in extended tests (unpacked tarball)
    lib/        # support library for robot
    run/        # where tests are run (and output written)
      base/       # where base tests are run
        <name>/     # additional grouping of base tests
      extended/   # where extended tests are run
        YYYY-DDD/   # extended tests for the given date
    target/     # target files (tarballs also cached here)
      base/       # target files for base tests
        <name>/     # additional grouping of base tests
      extended/   # target files for extended tests (unpacked tarballs)
        YYYY-DDD/   # extended tests for the given date
      
Note that directory structures under all, run and target should be
similar.
