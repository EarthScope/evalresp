This directory contains example code that calls evalresp from Fortran.  The code
has changed significantly since the previous release.  These changes were made to
simplify the maintenance of the code (by making the called routine more "C like")
and to bring the Fortran code up-to-date with Fortran 95 practices.

I apologise for any extra work this may imply when adapting to this release, but,
as far as I can tell, the existing Fortran code had no worked correctly for some
time (in particular, new parameters seemed to have been added after the implicit 
string length arguments used with f77).

Hopefully the example is sufficiently detailed to explain the new approach.
