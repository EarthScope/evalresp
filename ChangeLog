Version 3.3.3 
	27-Apr-2010 Ilya Dricker (i.dricker@isti.com)
	* FIXED: bug which prevented using evalresp with -stdio flag 
	* MIDFIED: Unwrapping now starts casual: first phase value is within (0:360) degree
Version 3.3.2
	12-Feb-2010 Ilya Dricker (i.dricker@isti.com)
	* MODIFIED: get_names() to properly parse file names: did not work under Mac OSX: done by Chad
	* MOVED: evalresp.man to evalresp.1
	* MOVED: What's New section of evalresp.1 to ChangeLog file
	* MODIFIED: printing a warning when using a negative delay
	* MODIFIED: evalresp man pages
	* REMOVED: evresp_adjust_phase() for 'fap' and 'ap' cases
	* RENAMED: parse_line() to ev_parse_line() to avoid naming conflict
	* MODIFIED: searching for RESP files now uses system glob().
Version 3.3.1
	29-Jan-2010 Ilya Dricker (i.dricker@isti.com)
	* NEW: Added a 'fap' response type with the -r option (in addition to the 'ap' and 'cs' types) to write out frequency-amplitude-phase triplets. 
	  The resulting file names are in the    form : "FAP.Net.Sta.Loc.Chan". The phase is always unwrapped in this output. 
	  Essential this is just a re-packaging of the amplitude-phase output into a single, three-column file with unwrapped phase.
	* NEW: Added run-time option (-unwrap) to unwrap the output phase in addition to the previous compile-time option.
	* NEW: Added option (-ts ?) to use the stage 0 total sensitivity instead of product of the stage gains.  
	   The idea is that this can be used in combination with the -stage option to provide a full scale response, i.e. just stage 1 (the sensor) 
	   with a correct system gain (which is exact what SAC Poles and Zeros do). 
	* NEW: Included checks for likely incorrect (negative) delay values; in case such delays are found evalresp prints a warning.
	* FIXED: Cleaned improper checks for IIR_PZ blockette types in calc_fctns.c and resp_fctns.c.
	* FXIED: Fixed search for matching RESP files, name search did not seem to use location ID.
	* FIXED: Documented the SEED requirements regarding the order of the FIR coefficients and the sign of the delay (see section below).
Version 3.3.0
	18-May-2009 Ilya Dricker (i.dricker@isti.com)
	* MODIFIED: This version modifies the way evalresp deals with the delays in FIR stages.
	  Note that -use-delay option becomes obsolete in this version
	  Now the following rules are applied for adding delays to the FIR stages: 
	    1: Calculation  of the response for a symmetrical FIR filter ignores the delay value in the RESP; 
	    2: Calculation of the response for an asymmetrical FIR filter uses the "correction applied"
	      field of the RESP by default and "estimated delay" field on user request (a user should use an
	      option -use-estimated-delay to switch this option on). This version has been tested to work on 64-bit processors.
Version 3.2.41
	29-Apr-2009 Ilya Dricker (i.dricker@isti.com)
	* MODIFIED: processing of delays in FIR stages.
	      Now the following rules are applied for adding delays to the FIR
	      stages:
	      1) Calculation of the response for a symmetrical FIR filter ignores
	      the delay value in the RESP;
	      2) Calculation of the response for an asymmetrical FIR filter
		uses the "correction applied" field of the RESP by default and
		"estimated delay" field on user request (a user should use an
		option -use-estimated-delay to switch this option on).
Version 3.2.40
	20-Jun-2008 Ilya Dricker (i.dricker@isti.com)
	* FIXED: bug in computation time limits
	25-Sep-2007 Ilya Dricker (i.dricker@isti.com)
	* REMOVED: 2 return statements in eversp which break LIB_MODE logic
Version 3.2.39

	   options;
Version 3.2.38
	04-Mar-2007 Ilya Dricker (i.dricker@isti.com)
	* ADDED: new configure option --enable-log-label
	  When evalresp is configured with this option, most of log messages
	  are being prepended by a label. A label consists of [Net.Sta.Loc.Chan].
	27-Feb-2007 Ilya Dricker (i.dricker@isti.com)
	* ADDED: Return (#ifdef LIB_MODE) if input file is not found
	01-Feb-2007 Ilya Dricker (i.dricker@isti.com)
	* FIXED: Bug pointed by <alessia@sismo.u-strasbg.fr> : use 
	  else if(!strcmp(argv[i], "-u")) instead of just if in evalresp.c:141
	08-Nov-2006 Ilya Dricker (i.dricker@isti.com)
	* NEW: Libtoolized evresp library: using libtool instead of ranlib.
	  Now a builder can create dynamic library, not only static
Version 3.2.37
	16-Oct-2006 Eric Thomas (e.thomas@isti.com)
	* ADDED:  two more 'free()' calls to "evresp.c" to fix memory leaks
	  when program functions are used in external applications.

	  program functions used in external applications.

	27-Mar-2006 Ilya Dricker (i.dricker@isti.com)
	* Added include_HEADERS target "evr_spline.h" to "Makefile.am".
	* UPGRADED: missing script.
Version 3.2.32
	13-Feb-2006 Eric Thomas (e.thomas@isti.com)
	* MOVED: 'use_delay()' function from 'evalresp.c' to 'evresp.c'.
	* MODIFIED: to close input file when a single response file is
	   specified.
Version 3.2.31
	19-Jan-2006 Eric Thomas (e.thomas@isti.com)
	* RENAMED: 'regexp' functions to prevent name clashes with other
	  libraries.
	  * RESTORED: 'depcomp' script in distribution.
Version 3.2.30
	3-Nov-2005 Eric Thomas (e.thomas@isti.com)
	* MODIFIED: to unwrap phase values before interpolation and re-wrap
	  after (if needed).
	* MODIFIED: to detect when all requested interpolated frequencies
	  are out of range.
Version 3.2.29
	21-Oct-2005 Eric Thomas (e.thomas@isti.com)
	* IMPLEMENTED: interpolation of amplitude/phase values from
	  responses containing List blockettes (55).
	* MODIFIED: message shown when List blockette encountered.
	* MODIFIED: so as not to require characters after 'units'
	  specifiers like "M" and "COUNTS".
	* MODIFIED: to handle case where file contains "B052F03 Location"
	  and nothing after it on line.
	* ADDED: warnings for unrecognized parameters.
	* FIXED: issue where program would crash under Linux/UNIX
	  "segmentation fault" if input response file contained
	  Windows-style "CR/LF" line ends.
Version 3.2.28
	2-Aug-2005 Eric Thomas (e.thomas@isti.com)
	* MODIFIED: to allow command-line parameters for frequency
	  values to be missing (default values used).

	* NEW: Now evalresp runs on Mac OS X
Version 3.2.25
	20-Jul-2005 Ilya Dricker (i.dricker@isti.com)

Version 3.2.23
	??? Ilya Dricker (i.dricker@isti.com)
	* ADDED: support for SHAPE compatible RESP files. When parsing lines that are valid
	  RESP format, but unexpected, evalresp now skips to the next line. Added support for blank lines within 
	  and at the end of a RESP file.
Version 3.2.21
	??? Ilya Dricker (i.dricker@isti.com)
	* NEW: Allows a user to compile and run evalresp on WIN32 platform.
	* FIXED: A bug in pole-zero representations for digital stages has been fixed.
