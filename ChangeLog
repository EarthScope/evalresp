Version 4.0.6

  07-Oct-2015 Andrew Cooke (a.cooke@isti.com)

  * ADDED: #define EVRESP_XML so that library code can detect the
    new functions (with xml flag).

Version 4.0.5

  09-Sep-2015 Andrew Cooke (a.cooke@isti.com)

  * MODIFIED: Added -x flag back; removed auto-detetcion of XML
    (cannot guarantee that rewind/fseek works on all streams in C).

Version 4.0.4

  07-Sep-2015 Andrew Cooke (a.cooke@isti.com)

  * MODIFIED: Documentation, removing mention of -x flag.

  * MODIFIED: File reset during auto-detection (from rewind to fseek)
    in the hope of working better on OSX.

Version 4.0.3

  27-Jul-2015 Andrew Cooke (a.cooke@isti.com)

  * REMOVED: -x flag.  Station.xml files are now detected automatically
    (by checking if the first non-blank character is "<").

  * FIXED: Small bug in reallocation of command line arg while addressing
    compiler warnings from -Wunused-but-set-variable.

  * MODIFIED: Handling of stages with "no data".  Now accepted, as they may
    still have decimation and channel gain.

  * MODIFIED: Handling of location ID '??' which is now equivalent to '*'.

Version 4.0.2

  01-Jun-2015 Andrew Cooke (a.cooke@isti.com)

  * FIXED: Compiler error on OSX.

Version 4.0.1

  22-May-2015 Andrew Cooke (a.cooke@isti.com)

  * MODIFIED: Fortran demo (fix passing of double array).

Version 4.0.0

  22-May-2015 Andrew Cooke (a.cooke@isti.com)

  * ADDED: Support for station.xml files (evalresp -x).  All high level
    functions take an additional flag indicating whether this is set.
    NOTE: this implies a new dependency on libxml2.

  * ADDED: The xml2resp command to convert from station.xml to
    response format (and man page), based on IRIS-WS output.

  * ADDED: Tests (configure --enable-check; make check).

  * ADDED: Continuous integration at https://phase2.isti.com:8080

  * ADDED: Support for COUNT units (as well as COUNTS).

  * ADDED: Installation of man pages.

  * MODIFIED: Fortran demo and associated code (works; now Fortran 95).

  * MODIFIED: Source: removed tabs; standardised indents; fixed warnings

  * MODIFIED: Documentation and directory layout (autoreconf, multiple
    directories).

  * MODIFIED: To build with latest Windows environment.

  * REMOVED: Borland support.


Version 3.3.4

  09-Oct-2013 Ilya Dricker (i.dricker@isti.com)

  * ADDED: processing of blockette 62 (which requires input parameter
    -b62_x)

  * MODIFIED: Redefined processing of DECIMATION as correction applied
    minus calculated delay

  * MODIFIED: Redifined processing of DECIMATION with
    --use-estimated-delay as estimated delay

  * FIXED: Reverted back to version 2.3.25 the code in function
    fir_asym_trans()

  * ADDED: support of temperature units in centigrades C 30-May-2013
    Ilya Dricker (i.dricker@isti.com)

  * FIXED: get_names() to properly process cases with the
    environmental variable SEEDRESP set


Version 3.3.3

  27-Apr-2010 Ilya Dricker (i.dricker@isti.com)

  * FIXED: bug which prevented using evalresp with -stdio flag

  * MIDFIED: Unwrapping now starts casual: first phase value is within
    (0:360) degree


Version 3.3.2

  12-Feb-2010 Ilya Dricker (i.dricker@isti.com)

  * MODIFIED: get_names() to properly parse file names: did not work
    under Mac OSX: done by Chad

  * MOVED: evalresp.man to evalresp.1

  * MOVED: What's New section of evalresp.1 to ChangeLog file

  * MODIFIED: printing a warning when using a negative delay

  * MODIFIED: evalresp man pages

  * REMOVED: evresp_adjust_phase() for 'fap' and 'ap' cases

  * RENAMED: parse_line() to ev_parse_line() to avoid naming conflict

  * MODIFIED: searching for RESP files now uses system glob().


Version 3.3.1

  29-Jan-2010 Ilya Dricker (i.dricker@isti.com)

  * NEW: Added a 'fap' response type with the -r option (in addition
    to the 'ap' and 'cs' types) to write out frequency-amplitude-phase
    triplets.  The resulting file names are in the form :
    "FAP.Net.Sta.Loc.Chan". The phase is always unwrapped in this
    output.  Essential this is just a re-packaging of the
    amplitude-phase output into a single, three-column file with
    unwrapped phase.

  * NEW: Added run-time option (-unwrap) to unwrap the output phase in
    addition to the previous compile-time option.

  * NEW: Added option (-ts ?) to use the stage 0 total sensitivity
    instead of product of the stage gains.  The idea is that this can
    be used in combination with the -stage option to provide a full
    scale response, i.e. just stage 1 (the sensor) with a correct
    system gain (which is exact what SAC Poles and Zeros do).

  * NEW: Included checks for likely incorrect (negative) delay values;
    in case such delays are found evalresp prints a warning.

  * FIXED: Cleaned improper checks for IIR_PZ blockette types in
    calc_fctns.c and resp_fctns.c.

  * FIXED: Fixed search for matching RESP files, name search did not
    seem to use location ID.

  * FIXED: Documented the SEED requirements regarding the order of the
    FIR coefficients and the sign of the delay (see section below).


Version 3.3.0

  18-May-2009 Ilya Dricker (i.dricker@isti.com)

  * MODIFIED: This version modifies the way evalresp deals with the
    delays in FIR stages.  Note that -use-delay option becomes
    obsolete in this version Now the following rules are applied for
    adding delays to the FIR stages:

    1: Calculation of the response for a symmetrical FIR filter
       ignores the delay value in the RESP;

    2: Calculation of the response for an asymmetrical FIR filter uses
       the "correction applied" field of the RESP by default and
       "estimated delay" field on user request (a user should use an
       option -use-estimated-delay to switch this option on). This
       version has been tested to work on 64-bit processors.


Version 3.2.41

  29-Apr-2009 Ilya Dricker (i.dricker@isti.com)

  * MODIFIED: processing of delays in FIR stages.

    Now the following rules are applied for adding delays to the FIR
    stages:

    1: Calculation of the response for a symmetrical FIR filter
       ignores the delay value in the RESP;

    2: Calculation of the response for an asymmetrical FIR filter uses
       the "correction applied" field of the RESP by default and
       "estimated delay" field on user request (a user should use an
       option -use-estimated-delay to switch this option on).


Version 3.2.40

  20-Jun-2008 Ilya Dricker (i.dricker@isti.com)

  * FIXED: bug in computation time limits 25-Sep-2007 Ilya Dricker

    configurable options;


Version 3.2.38

  04-Mar-2007 Ilya Dricker (i.dricker@isti.com)

  * ADDED: new configure option --enable-log-label When evalresp is
    configured with this option, most of log messages are being
    prepended by a label. A label consists of [Net.Sta.Loc.Chan].
    27-Feb-2007 Ilya Dricker (i.dricker@isti.com)

  * ADDED: Return (#ifdef LIB_MODE) if input file is not found
    01-Feb-2007 Ilya Dricker (i.dricker@isti.com)

  * FIXED: Bug pointed by <alessia@sismo.u-strasbg.fr> : use else
    if(!strcmp(argv[i], "-u")) instead of just if in evalresp.c:141
    08-Nov-2006 Ilya Dricker (i.dricker@isti.com)

  * NEW: Libtoolized evresp library: using libtool instead of ranlib.
    Now a builder can create dynamic library, not only static


Version 3.2.37

  28-Mar-2006 Eric Thomas (e.thomas@isti.com)

  * ADDED: 'free()' calls to "evresp.c" to fix memory leaks when
  program functions used in external applications.


Version 3.2.33

  27-Mar-2006 Ilya Dricker (i.dricker@isti.com)

  * MODIFIED: to close input file when a single response file is
    specified.


Version 3.2.31

  19-Jan-2006 Eric Thomas (e.thomas@isti.com)

  * RENAMED: 'regexp' functions to prevent name clashes with other
    libraries.

  * RESTORED: 'depcomp' script in distribution.


Version 3.2.30

  3-Nov-2005 Eric Thomas (e.thomas@isti.com)

  * MODIFIED: to unwrap phase values before interpolation and re-wrap

  * MODIFIED: to detect when all requested interpolated frequencies
    are out of range.


Version 3.2.29

  21-Oct-2005 Eric Thomas (e.thomas@isti.com)

  * IMPLEMENTED: interpolation of amplitude/phase values from
    responses containing List blockettes (55).

  * MODIFIED: message shown when List blockette encountered.

  * MODIFIED: so as not to require characters after 'units' specifiers
    like "M" and "COUNTS".

  * MODIFIED: to handle case where file contains "B052F03 Location"
    and nothing after it on line.

  * ADDED: warnings for unrecognized parameters.

  * FIXED: issue where program would crash under Linux/UNIX
    "segmentation fault" if input response file contained
    Windows-style "CR/LF" line ends.


Version 3.2.28

  2-Aug-2005 Eric Thomas (e.thomas@isti.com)

  * MODIFIED: to allow command-line parameters for frequency values to
    be missing (default values used).


Version 3.2.27
