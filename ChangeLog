Version 5.0.1

	2022-03-27 Chad Trabant

	* FIXED: Fix memory issues with legacy interfaces and add known Units (#72)
	from @savage13.

	* FIXED: Properly treat StationXML 'number' attribute as optional
	for Pole, Zero and Coefficient elements.  Converted values in RESP
	will be 0.

	* FIXED: Avoid double-free in free_stages() and remove stub code.

	* IMPROVED: Retain documented unit strings and include them in
	returned structure and use to improve diagnostic/verbose output.

	* IMPROVED: Include requested units in diagnostic output.

	* IMPROVED: Properly recognize date times of 1970-01-01T00:00:00
	StationXML to avoid treating them as "open".

	* IMPROVED: Allow StationXML input without an XML declaration,
	aka the <?xml ... ?> prefix which is not required by StationXML.

	* IMPROVED: Always re-compile binary targets in default target,
        as dependencies are not provided for make to determine when needed.

Version 5.0.0

	09-04-2019 Chad Trabant

	* IMPROVED: Autodetect file format by default, when
	options.station_xml == 0.

	* IMPROVED: Rename Makefile.unix to Makefile and Makefile.ms
	to Makefile.nmake.

	* IMPROVED: Fix many compiler warnings.

	* MODIFIED: Update Mini-XML library from 2.10 to 2.12.

	21-08-2018 Chad Trabant

	* IMPROVED: Allow StationXML files to be autodetected when
	options.station_xml == -1.

	* IMPROVED: Use mxmlLoadFile() instead of mxmlLoadFd() to avoid
	unnecessary indirection.  Also fixes rewinding of file stream.

Version 5.0.a3

	18-07-2018 Andrew Cooke (a.cooke@isti.com), Ilya Dricker, Dylan
	Thies

	* FIXED: Bug that resulted in gain being reused from an earlier
	stage if not specified (and subsequenct memory corruption on
	free).

	* IMPROVED: Build for libxml (use simple make).

	* IMPROVED: Automated testing.

Version 5.0.a2

	18-08-2017 Ilya Dricker (i.dricker@isti.com), Dylan Thies, Andrew
	Cooke

	* FIXED: Many bugs introduced in rewrite.

Version 5.0.a1

	26-July-2017 Ilya Dricker (i.dricker@isti.com), Andrew Cooke,
	Dylan Thies

	* NEW: Significant re-factorization and rewrite of the of the
	evalresp code

	* NEW: A rewrite of the evalresp source code in addition to
	enhancements for embedded usage.

	* NEW: C99 compliance

	* IMPROVED: Removal of the compiler warnings on gcc, clang/llvm

	* IMPROVED: Normalized source code style

	* IMPROVED: Applied best practices: no use of goto,
	setjmp/longjmp, and other constructs that make code hard to follow
	and maintain.

	* REPLACED: short non-descriptive naming conventions,

	* IMPROVED: Normalize source code formatting using a clang-format
	profile (provided by IRIS).

	* MODIFIED: Exposed and document structures that can be used to
	express a response cascade and provide functions for evaluation.

	* MODIFIED: Provided functions to accept RESP and StationXML from
	memory buffers, that then use the lower level interfaces.

	* NEW: Provided functions that perform “file discovery” and then
	use the lower level interfaces.

	* NEW: Provided explicit definitions (enums or defines) for input
	and output units and focused functionality

	* NEW: Provided a common logging facility for error, diagnostic
	and verbose messaging.

	* NEW: Created unit and black-box testing system based on Robot
	framework

	* NEW: Created Doxyen-based Developer's Guide

	* NEW: Created a system with a plain Makefile and nmake
	Makefile.win (for Windows).

	* MODIFIED: Replace usage of libxml2 with an embedded solution

	* MODIFIED: Replaced GPL-based splining functions with LGPL
	countreparts

	* NEW: Moved the source code to IRIS Github

Version 4.0.7

	10-Mar-2016 Ilya Dricker (i.dricker@isti.com)

	* FIXED: a typo in test/java/Makefile.am file

Version 4.0.6

	07-Oct-2015 Andrew Cooke (a.cooke@isti.com)

	* ADDED: #define EVRESP_XML so that library code can detect the
	new functions (with xml flag).

Version 4.0.5

	09-Sep-2015 Andrew Cooke (a.cooke@isti.com)

	* MODIFIED: Added -x flag back; removed auto-detetcion of XML
	(cannot guarantee that rewind/fseek works on all streams in C).

Version 4.0.4

	07-Sep-2015 Andrew Cooke (a.cooke@isti.com)

	* MODIFIED: Documentation, removing mention of -x flag.

	* MODIFIED: File reset during auto-detection (from rewind to
	fseek) in the hope of working better on OSX.

Version 4.0.3

	27-Jul-2015 Andrew Cooke (a.cooke@isti.com)

	* REMOVED: -x flag.  Station.xml files are now detected
	automatically
	(by checking if the first non-blank character is "<").

	* FIXED: Small bug in reallocation of command line arg while
	addressing compiler warnings from -Wunused-but-set-variable.

	* MODIFIED: Handling of stages with "no data".  Now accepted, as
	they may still have decimation and channel gain.

	* MODIFIED: Handling of location ID '??' which is now equivalent
	to '*'.

Version 4.0.2

	01-Jun-2015 Andrew Cooke (a.cooke@isti.com)

	* FIXED: Compiler error on OSX.

Version 4.0.1

	22-May-2015 Andrew Cooke (a.cooke@isti.com)

	* MODIFIED: Fortran demo (fix passing of double array).

Version 4.0.0

	22-May-2015 Andrew Cooke (a.cooke@isti.com)

	* ADDED: Support for station.xml files (evalresp -x).  All high
	level functions take an additional flag indicating whether this is
	set.  NOTE: this implies a new dependency on libxml2.

	* ADDED: The xml2resp command to convert from station.xml to
	response format (and man page), based on IRIS-WS output.

	* ADDED: Tests (configure --enable-check; make check).

	* ADDED: Continuous integration at https://phase2.isti.com:8080

	* ADDED: Support for COUNT units (as well as COUNTS).

	* ADDED: Installation of man pages.

	* MODIFIED: Fortran demo and associated code (works; now Fortran
	95).

	* MODIFIED: Source: removed tabs; standardised indents; fixed
	warnings

	* MODIFIED: Documentation and directory layout (autoreconf,
	multiple directories).

	* MODIFIED: To build with latest Windows environment.

	* REMOVED: Borland support.

Version 3.3.4

	09-Oct-2013 Ilya Dricker (i.dricker@isti.com)

	* ADDED: processing of blockette 62 (which requires input
	parameter -b62_x)

	* MODIFIED: Redefined processing of DECIMATION as correction
	applied minus calculated delay

	* MODIFIED: Redifined processing of DECIMATION with
	--use-estimated-delay as estimated delay

	* FIXED: Reverted back to version 2.3.25 the code in function
	fir_asym_trans()

	* ADDED: support of temperature units in centigrades C 30-May-2013
	Ilya Dricker (i.dricker@isti.com)

	* FIXED: get_names() to properly process cases with the
	environmental variable SEEDRESP set

Version 3.3.3

	27-Apr-2010 Ilya Dricker (i.dricker@isti.com)

	* FIXED: bug which prevented using evalresp with -stdio flag

	* MIDFIED: Unwrapping now starts casual: first phase value is
	within(0:360) degree

Version 3.3.2

	12-Feb-2010 Ilya Dricker (i.dricker@isti.com)

	* MODIFIED: get_names() to properly parse file names: did not work
	under Mac OSX: done by Chad

	* MOVED: evalresp.man to evalresp.1

	* MOVED: What's New section of evalresp.1 to ChangeLog file

	* MODIFIED: printing a warning when using a negative delay

	* MODIFIED: evalresp man pages

	* REMOVED: evresp_adjust_phase() for 'fap' and 'ap' cases

	* RENAMED: parse_line() to ev_parse_line() to avoid naming
	conflict

	* MODIFIED: searching for RESP files now uses system glob().

Version 3.3.1

	29-Jan-2010 Ilya Dricker (i.dricker@isti.com)

	* NEW: Added a 'fap' response type with the -r option (in addition
	to the 'ap' and 'cs' types) to write out frequency-amplitude-phase
	triplets.  The resulting file names are in the form :
	"FAP.Net.Sta.Loc.Chan". The phase is always unwrapped in this
	output.  Essential this is just a re-packaging of the
	amplitude-phase output into a single, three-column file with
	unwrapped phase.

	* NEW: Added run-time option (-unwrap) to unwrap the output phase
	in addition to the previous compile-time option.

	* NEW: Added option (-ts ?) to use the stage 0 total sensitivity
	instead of product of the stage gains.  The idea is that this can
	be used in combination with the -stage option to provide a full
	scale response, i.e. just stage 1 (the sensor) with a correct
	system gain (which is exact what SAC Poles and Zeros do).

	* NEW: Included checks for likely incorrect (negative) delay
	values; in case such delays are found evalresp prints a warning.

	* FIXED: Cleaned improper checks for IIR_PZ blockette types in
	calc_fctns.c and resp_fctns.c.

	* FIXED: Fixed search for matching RESP files, name search did not
	seem to use location ID.

	* FIXED: Documented the SEED requirements regarding the order of
	the FIR coefficients and the sign of the delay (see section
	below).

Version 3.3.0

	18-May-2009 Ilya Dricker (i.dricker@isti.com)

	* MODIFIED: This version modifies the way evalresp deals with the
	delays in FIR stages.  Note that -use-delay option becomes
	obsolete in this version Now the following rules are applied for
	adding delays to the FIR stages:

	1: Calculation of the response for a symmetrical FIR filter
	ignores the delay value in the RESP;

	2: Calculation of the response for an asymmetrical FIR filter uses
	the "correction applied" field of the RESP by default and
	"estimated delay" field on user request (a user should use an
	option -use-estimated-delay to switch this option on). This
	version has been tested to work on 64-bit processors.

Version 3.2.41

	29-Apr-2009 Ilya Dricker (i.dricker@isti.com)

	* MODIFIED: processing of delays in FIR stages.

	Now the following rules are applied for adding delays to the FIR
	stages:

	1: Calculation of the response for a symmetrical FIR filter
	ignores the delay value in the RESP;

	2: Calculation of the response for an asymmetrical FIR filter uses
	the "correction applied" field of the RESP by default and
	"estimated delay" field on user request (a user should use an
	option -use-estimated-delay to switch this option on).

Version 3.2.40

	20-Jun-2008 Ilya Dricker (i.dricker@isti.com)

	* FIXED: bug in computation time limits 25-Sep-2007 Ilya Dricker
	(i.dricker@isti.com)

	* REMOVED: 2 return statements in eversp which break LIB_MODE
	logic

Version 3.2.39

	12-Jul-2007 Ilya Dricker (i.dricker@isti.com)

	* REMOVED: -g -Wall hardcoded flags from configure.in. Made them
	configurable options;

Version 3.2.38

	04-Mar-2007 Ilya Dricker (i.dricker@isti.com)

	* ADDED: new configure option --enable-log-label When evalresp is
	configured with this option, most of log messages are being
	prepended by a label. A label consists of [Net.Sta.Loc.Chan].
	27-Feb-2007 Ilya Dricker (i.dricker@isti.com)

	* ADDED: Return (#ifdef LIB_MODE) if input file is not found
	01-Feb-2007 Ilya Dricker (i.dricker@isti.com)

	* FIXED: Bug pointed by <alessia@sismo.u-strasbg.fr> : use else
	if(!strcmp(argv[i], "-u")) instead of just if in evalresp.c:141
	08-Nov-2006 Ilya Dricker (i.dricker@isti.com)

	* NEW: Libtoolized evresp library: using libtool instead of
	ranlib.  Now a builder can create dynamic library, not only static

Version 3.2.37

	16-Oct-2006 Eric Thomas (e.thomas@isti.com)

	* ADDED: two more 'free()' calls to "evresp.c" to fix memory leaks
	when program functions are used in external applications.

Version 3.2.36

	21-Aug-2006 Ilya Dricker (i.dricker@isti.com)

	* Modified to support Tesla ("T") units.

Version 3.2.35

	4-Apr-2006 Eric Thomas (e.thomas@isti.com)

	* MODIFIED: to support channel-IDs with location codes equal to an
	empty string.

Version 3.2.34

	28-Mar-2006 Eric Thomas (e.thomas@isti.com)

	* ADDED: 'free()' calls to "evresp.c" to fix memory leaks when
	program functions used in external applications.

Version 3.2.33

	27-Mar-2006 Ilya Dricker (i.dricker@isti.com)

	* Added include_HEADERS target "evr_spline.h" to "Makefile.am".

	* UPGRADED: missing script.

Version 3.2.32

	13-Feb-2006 Eric Thomas (e.thomas@isti.com)

	* MOVED: 'use_delay()' function from 'evalresp.c' to 'evresp.c'.

	* MODIFIED: to close input file when a single response file is
	specified.

Version 3.2.31

	19-Jan-2006 Eric Thomas (e.thomas@isti.com)

	* RENAMED: 'regexp' functions to prevent name clashes with other
	libraries.

	* RESTORED: 'depcomp' script in distribution.

Version 3.2.30

	3-Nov-2005 Eric Thomas (e.thomas@isti.com)

	* MODIFIED: to unwrap phase values before interpolation and
	re-wrap after (if needed).

	* MODIFIED: to detect when all requested interpolated frequencies
	are out of range.

Version 3.2.29

	21-Oct-2005 Eric Thomas (e.thomas@isti.com)

	* IMPLEMENTED: interpolation of amplitude/phase values from
	responses containing List blockettes (55).

	* MODIFIED: message shown when List blockette encountered.

	* MODIFIED: so as not to require characters after 'units'
	specifiers like "M" and "COUNTS".

	* MODIFIED: to handle case where file contains "B052F03 Location"
	and nothing after it on line.

	* ADDED: warnings for unrecognized parameters.

	* FIXED: issue where program would crash under Linux/UNIX
	"segmentation fault" if input response file contained
	Windows-style "CR/LF" line ends.

Version 3.2.28

	2-Aug-2005 Eric Thomas (e.thomas@isti.com)

	* MODIFIED: to allow command-line parameters for frequency values
	to be missing (default values used).

Version 3.2.27

	1-Mar-2005 Ilya Dricker(i.dricker@isti.com)

	* ADDED: -add-delay command line option

Version 3.2.26

	20-Oct-2004 Ilya Dricker (i.dricker@isti.com)

	* NEW: Now evalresp runs on Mac OS X

Version 3.2.25

	20-Jul-2005 Ilya Dricker (i.dricker@isti.com)

	* STARTED: Finally, we started ChangeLog

	* FIXED: Processing of B55 + GAIN stage is now allowed

	* ADDED: config.h to the source code and AM_CONFIG_HEADER to
	configure.in

Version 3.2.24

	05-Apr-2004 Ilya Dricker (i.dricker@isti.com)

	* ADDED: two confuration options (--enable-delay Use estimated
	delay in phase computation) and (--enable-phase-unwrap Unwrap
	phase).

Version 3.2.23

	19-Mar-2004 SBH

	* ADDED: support for SHAPE compatible RESP files. When parsing
	lines that are valid RESP format, but unexpected, evalresp now
	skips to the next line. Added support for blank lines within and
	at the end of a RESP file.

Version 3.2.22

	21-Oct-2003 Ilya Dricker (i.dricker@isti.com)

	* FIXED: evaluation of the response for an IIR filter. Versions
	before 2.3.20 computed IIR PZ incorrectly. Versions 3.2.20-21
	computed amplitude of the filter properly, while PHASE was
	improperly multiplied by (-1), mirrored aross y = 0. This release
	fixes the problem.

	* ADDED: Interpolation of blockette 55 (to enable this feature,
	the program should be compiled with -DB55_INTRPL compilation flag,
	which is not set by default). This feature is experimaental and
	not recommended for the general use.

Version 3.2.21

	21-May-2002 Ilya Dricker (i.dricker@isti.com)

	* NEW: Allows a user to compile and run evalresp on WIN32
	platform.

	* FIXED: A bug in pole-zero representations for digital stages has
	been fixed.

	* ADDDED: Partial support for generic response blockette. Partial
	means that if such blockette is found, evalresp ignores the
	blockette, prints a warning and continues execution. Previous
	versions considered the generic response blockette to be offensive
	and terminated the processing of the response

Version 3.2.20

	28-Aug-2001 Eric Thomas (e.thomas@isti.com)

	* NEW: Code ported to work with Microsoft Windows-based compilers.
	Functionality should be unchanged.

Version 3.2.19

	30-July-2001 Ilya Dricker (i.dricker@isti.com)

	* FIXED: A bug which forced evalresp to compute incorrect group
	delays has been fixed.

	* REMOVED: A computation of decimation is removed from
	evalresp. To compute decimation evalresp relies upon the fields 7
	and 8 of SEED blockette 57. However, the use of these fields are
	inconsistant among digitizers and SEED builders.

	* MOFIFIED: A mechinism of selecting files for processing from the
	working directory for some Solaris computers was shown to be
	unrelible in at least a single case in all versions below
	3.2.19. This mechanism was modified. As a trade-off the acessing
	of a single RESP file in versions 3.2.19 and above is slower by
	about one second than in the previous versions.

Version 3.2.18

	??? Ilya Dricker (i.dricker@isti.com)

	* NEW: Presure data support is included

Version 3.2.17

	??? Ilya Dricker (i.dricker@isti.com)

	* NEW: Modifications from version 3.2.16 to version 3.2.17 are
	conduced by Instrumental Software Technologies,
	Inc. (www.isti.com) Modifications have been requested by IRIS
	DMC. These modifications include:

	* MODIFIED: Version 3.2.17 supports IIR digital filters in coeffi­
	cients format with a non-zero phase shift.  IIR coeffi­ cients for
	a single stage must fit in a single blockette.  The algorithm was
	adopted from the FORTRAN code provided by B. Hutt
	(hutt@asl.cr.usgs.gov).

	* MODIFIED: Version 3.2.17 and above supports generic response
	block­ ette (SEED blockettes 55).  Generic response blockette is a
	list of phases and amplitudes computed for the prese­ lected set
	of frequencies. This filter type is supported only if the response
	input file contains blockette(s) 55 as a stage 1 and possibly
	channel sensitivity blockette as a stage 0.  If generic response
	blockette is recognized in the input, evalresp ignores the
	user-defined frequency sampling from the command line. The ouput,
	therefore, con­ tains responses for only those frequencies which
	have been defined in the generic response blockette.

	* MODIFIED: The source code is cleaned; all unused variables are
	removed

	* MODIFIED: The man pages are modified to reflect the current
	version of the evalresp.

Version 3.0 to version 3.2

	14-03-1997 TJM (tjm@iris.washington.edu)

	(1) Error handling improved.  In version 3.0, if the end of the
	file was encountered while searching for the next response, an
	extraneous error message was often printed to the effect of

	EVRESP ERROR: get_line (parsing blockette [050]); unexpected fld
	number fld_xpt=F16, fld_found=F03, skipping to next response now

	when, in fact, a message should have appeared that this
	sta-chan-net tuple was not found.  In version 3.1 so that the
	message that now appears is

	WARNING: no response found for
	STA=ANMO,CHAN=SHZ,DATE=1994,122,00:00:00

	(2) Error messages improved.  In version 3.0, when an error was
	printed, there was no information in the error input as to where
	in the process the error occurred.  While this may have been
	apparent if only a few files were being processed, it was not at
	all obvious where the error occurred if a large number of
	sta-cha-net files were being processed.  To improve this,

	(a) The name of the file that is being parsed has been added to
	all error messages.  For example, if an error occurred while
	parsing the file response information for the ANMO LHZ channel as
	reported by the SRO network because the line containing the
	network code was missing, evalresp v3.0 would have reported

        EVRESP ERROR: get_line; blkt and fld numbers do not match expected
	values blkt_xpt=B050, blkt_found=B052; fld_xpt=F16, fld_found=F04,
	skipping to next response now

        whereas evalresp v3.1 reports (for the same parsing error)

        EVRESP ERROR (RESP.SR.ANMO.LHZ): get_line; blkt and fld numbers do
	not match expected values blkt_xpt=B050, blkt_found=B052;
	fld_xpt=F16, fld_found=F04, skipping to next response now

	(3) Changes were made to make the code more portable.  Although
	the code was 'test compiled' on a DEC ALPHA and on SUNs running
	SUNOS 4.1.3, problems were encountered when porting the code to
	the HPUX OS.  To make the code more portable, the following
	changes were made.

	(a) The buffer length for the output of the child process that
	lists the directory to find matching files has been set to zero
	using 'setbuf' rather than 'setlinebuf'.  Again, this change was
	made so that the code would be 'ANSI standard'.

	(b) The calls to 'getwd()' have been replaced with calls to
	'getcwd()', which seems to be more 'standard' than 'getwd()', as
	it exists as part of the SUN OS, the DEC OS, and the HPUX OS

	(c) Finally, the 're_comp()' and 're_exec()' routines, which are
	not part of the ANSI standard C standard library, do not seem to
	be supported under the HPUX OS (although both the DEC Unix OS and
	SUN OS do support them).  As a result, code is included in this
	distribution for a set of routines taken from Henry Spencer's
	'regexp' utility that implement 'regular expression' pattern
	matching in the style of the UNIX utility 'egrep'.  The new files
	are: 'regexp.c', 'regsub.c', 'regerror.c', 'regexp.h', and
	'regmagic.h'.  The 'main' routines of this package (which are used
	in place of 're_comp()' and 're_exec()') are called 'regcomp()'
	and 'regexec()', respectively.  The inclusion of these files
	should result in a more portable distribution, since the only
	function calls made in this package are to ANSI standard library
	functions.

        This package was obtained via anonymous ftp from the University of
	Toronto, and minimal changes have been made to make it more
	compatible with 'evalresp'.  Specifically, a few '#include'
	directives were removed that were not needed for the routines to
	be used as a 'stand-alone' package and several redeclarations of
	the 'strchr()' standard library function in the file 'regexp.c'
	were replaced with an '#include <string.h>' statement at the
	beginning of that code.  The following statements are taken from
	the 'README' file for this package and are included to give credit
	where credit is due:

                 This is a nearly-public-domain reimplementation of the V8
	regexp(3) package.  It gives C programs the ability to use
	egrep-style regular expressions, and does it in a much cleaner
	fashion than the analogous routines in SysV.

                 This implementation is *NOT* AT&T/Bell code, and is not
	derived from licensed software.  Even though U of T is a V8
	licensee.  This software is based on a V8 manual page sent to me
	by Dennis Ritchie (the manual page enclosed here is a complete
	rewrite and hence is not covered by AT&T copyright).  The software
	was nearly complete at the time of arrival of our V8 tape.  I
	haven't even looked at V8 yet, although a friend elsewhere at U of
	T has been kind enough to run a few test programs using the V8
	regexp(3) to resolve a few fine points.  I admit to some
	familiarity with regular-expression implementations of the past,
	but the only one that this code traces any ancestry to is the one
	published in Kernighan & Plauger (from which this one draws ideas
	but not code).

	(4) Bug fixed for handling of FIR filters.  If a FIR filter was
	renormalized in version 3.0, the normalization constant for that
	filter was not changed to compensate.  As a result the response of
	channels with FIR filter stages that were renormalized to a
	constant frequency are not correct in evalresp v3.0.

	(5) A fourth option was added to the 'output units'.  If this
	option is chosen, then the response that is returned to the user
	will be in terms of the input units per output units, regardless
	of the unit themselves.  This was done to allow responses to be
	calculated for magnetometers, strain meters, and pressure, or
	temperature sensors, where it really doesn't make sense to talk
	about the 'units' in terms of displacement, velocity, or
	acceleration, but the user would still like to see the frequency
	response of the instrument.  If the flag '-u def' is chosen, then
	evalresp will calculate the response spectra for these types of
	instruments, if any other units are specified, these types of
	instruments will be skipped as having 'unrecognized' types of
	units (i.e. units that cannot be converted into the type of units
	that the user requested).

	(6) many bugs that were reported by users in the way that evalresp
	went about evaluation of responses have been fixed.  Some of these
	problems were due to the fact that evalresp expected the
	blockettes to appear in a certain order (when, in fact, the SEED
	format did not), while others had to do with legal SEED constructs
	that had not been seen yet (and, as a result, where not tested
	before the release of version 3.0).  In some cases, the response
	values calculated by evalresp were found to be in error by several
	percent, while in other cases evalresp failed to correctly parse
	legal filter sequences.  In each case, the bug reports were traced
	and fixes were made.  Thanks to the beta test group for all of the
	work that they put in on this.

	(7) a "-stdio" command line flag has been added that allows
	evalresp to be placed into a "pipeline".  In fact, this
	functionality is already in use here at the DMC in calculation of
	responses from a set of "stage response files".  When the "-stdio"
	command line flag is set, the program takes input
	(which is assumed to be from a RESP file or a series of RESP
	files) from stdin and returns the calculated responses to stdout.
	The format is slightly different than the format used to output
	the calculated responses when the output is to a file, since there
	are multiple station-channel-netword tuple's responses being
	returned to stdout.  Basically, the program adds a short header to
	the stdout stream so that the responses can be separated later by
	whatever application program will be receiving the output from
	evalresp.  As always, the verbose output and error output both
	appear on stderr, so they will not appear mixed in with the
	calculated responses.

	(8) a new command line option was defined to allow users to
	evaluate the response for a subset of the overall response for a
	channel.  This option allows users to specify the stage (or range
	of stages) that they wish to evaluate the response for.  If
	response stages are skipped in this process, then evalresp will
	not compare the calculated overall sensitivity with the reported
	overall sensitivity in the RESP file, since the calculated
	response leaves out parts of the response file.  This option is
	useful for looking at the effect of individual response stages on
	the overall response (and for checking for problems with a stage
	that is under construction).
